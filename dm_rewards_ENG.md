# DM rewards

## Initial arrangements

### Dungeon Master status

Dungeon Master (DM) is someone who had run at least one game at an open table for OPK in last half a year. Losing DM status does not result in losing all earned DM rewards.

### Adventures, sessions and runtime hours
In all the below statements and tables, adventure means a single piece of content designated with adventure code for the purposes of running it in OPK. Session is a single run of such adventure (even if players had to meet on more than a single meeting to complete the adventure). Same adventure can be run multiple times, but it will still count as a single adventure for completing missions. If the adventure consists of multiple mini-adventures, all of it still counts as a single adventure for the purposes of missions. Example: Running 4 out of 5 miniadventures of DDEX1-1 Defiance in Phlan counts as a single session and adventure with 4 hours of runtime.
Runtime hours are based on the planned runtime for the adventure, regardless of how long it actually takes.

### Types of rewards for running games in OPK

For running games in OPK, DMs earn 3 types of rewards: 
 - ACP in amounts analogous to players. 
 - Magic Item Points (MIP), ensuring DM characters have similiar amount of magic items to player characters.
 - Quest Points (QP), which are earned for running games in specific, exceptionally beneficial ways: regular, varied, inclusive for new players.
For QP DMs can buy "cosmetic" rewards, which are not supposed to increase character power, but are giving options too unique for the standard setting of adventures - that includes uncommon races, familiars, rebuilds and resurrections.

## Basic rewards

### Advancement Checkpoints

For running the game, DM earns maximum amount of ACP from story objectives and any ACP from bonus objectives that the party had earned.
If average level of the party is less than 2, DM earns ACP equal to highest amount earned by any of the players, including 0 in case of TPK.
Dungeon Master can assign earned ACP to his characters in portions of any size. Assigning ACP to character also grants it, for every assigned point:
 - 2,5 DT
 - amount of gold based on the Tier of character

| Character's tier    | Gold (gp)  |
|---------------------|------------|
| I                   | 40         |
| II                  | 175        |
| III                 | 450        |
| IV                  | 4500       |

ACP can only be assigned to living characters.

### Magic Item Points and Quest Points

Running adventures also earns Magic Item Points (MIP) and Quest Points (QP). The amount is equal to ACP earned for adventure times tier-based factor, according to the table below.

| Adventure's tier | PMP/PQ for 1 ACP |
|------------------|------------------|
| I                | 2,5              |
| II               | 2                |
| III              | 1,5              |
| IV               | 1                |

Example: Running a 2 ACP adventure for Tier 1, DM earns 5 MIP and 5 QP. Runnning 4 ACP adventure for Tier 3, DM earns 6 MIP and 6 QP.

MIP can be spent to grant one of DMs characters magic item or spellbook, following restrictions in section 1.5. of these rules.
DM can only grant items from the pool of magic items available in adventures run by the DM. Each item costs 50 MIP.

QP can be spend as described in table [quest rewards](#quest-rewards)

Character cannot be granted magic item, if after assigning it, character would be above any of the following limits:
 - T1 character - 1 Uncommon and 0 Rare and higher items
 - T2 character - 2 Uncommon, 1 Rare and 0 Very Rare or higher items
 - T3 character - 3 Uncommon, 2 Rare, 1 Very Rare and 0 Legendary items

DM can still grant items of different rarity as long as they are within the limit for that rarity.
Example: T2 character can be granted a rare item even if it has 4 Uncommon items (but it cannot be granted an Uncommon one).

### Sessions zero
Adventures that are not allowed for standard Adventurers League play need to be adjusted for our standards by running session zero and adding them to OPK Content Catalog (details in [Content Catalog](content_catalog.md))

In addition to DM that wants the adventure added to CC, session zero should include experienced players/other DMs. DM decides on the adventure's tier and players (in agreement with DM) can prepare any legal character of that Tier (including magic items). It can be a copy of existing character.

DMs or players taking part in session zero earn QP reward (see table), but no other rewards. Running session zero counts as session for the "Quart for a Quarter" quest, but not for any other quests.

### Epic Adventures
So called "epics" are run at several tables in the same time (usually across more than one tier), with the assistance of cooridinating DMs.

Taking into account difficulties organasing such an event, every DM (both ones running the games and coordinating) taking part receives following rewards:

 - ACP, MIP and QP based on lowest tier table from the event, times 2(if epic has 4 hours of runtime and has T1 and T2 tables, every DM earns rewards as for running 8 hours of T1 adventures)
 - gains access to all magic items present in the adventures
 - can count epic adventure for his DM quests

If it's the first time given epic adventure is going to be run in OPK, preparations for each track should include session zero for that track. Such session zero is rewarded according to normal session zero rules.

#### Table 1<a name="table-races" ></a>
Keep in mind that following races may not be suitable for the theme of the adventure - it's advised to contact DM before you bring such character to the session and respect his right to refuse. Regardless of DMs decision, some NPCs may be distrustful or openly hostile to some races (e.g. plasmoid, being an Ooze).

### Design Principles
The fundamental goal of these rewards is to ensure players have as much enjoyment from DM's sessions as possible. We do not want for DM characters to be significantly weaker than those that take part in DM's sessions, but they also shouldn't be stronger. Additionally, we want to reward behaviours that are beneficial for our community - we do not want to reward for challanges that are hard to achieve, yet do not bring much benefit to the players. We also want to promote bringing new players into the community, which is why lower tiers grant more MIP and QP.
